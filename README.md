Code Styles
=========
These are the code styles I adhere by in the projects I work on. I try to follow the official standards as close as possible,
but most times it's the little things where differences occur; therefore, I adapted my own style based of the languange's
official standard. Although these are my personal preferences, I am flexible and adapt to the styles used on different teams
and projects.

For the languages I use, I've added documentation on my differences while stating which standard I follow and base it on.

Have a look at the languages and see the code style I personally adhere by on new projects, or projects at the workplace.
